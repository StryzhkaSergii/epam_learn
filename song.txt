I pray that I donâ€™t give up
Pray that I do my best
Pray that I can lift up
Pray my brother is blessed

some content
Judge nobody and forgive me my sins
I pray we make it

Pray that we make it to the end of the day
And so We Pray
I know somewhere that heaven is waiting

And so We Pray
And so We Pray
And so We Pray
